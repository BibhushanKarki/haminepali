      "On 20th May,2021 midnight HamiNepal received an SOS call from Star hospital as their oxygen supplier had experienced an explosion. They informed us that 57 patients were under high flow oxygen therapy and needed immediate help. It was a matter of life and death so our team rushed to the hospital. With the help of APF, Trauma center, Jyapu Samaj, Sita oxygen plant, Sagarmatha Oxygen plant, Sankar Oxygen plant, Manab Kalyan and other individuals 57 oxygen cylinders were provided to Star Hospital. We are grateful towards everyone who helped us save those 57 lives. Through the coordination of Hami Nepal the volunteers were able to deliver 43 cylinders within 2 hours. Together we can make a difference and yesterday was a testament of that.Number of cylinders provided: APF Dr. Prabin - 10,Trauma center Dr. Santosh - 10,Jyapu Samaj - 11, Sita oxygen plant - 5,Sagarmatha Oxygen plant - 4,Sankar Oxygen plant - 5, Manab Kalyan - 6,Other individuals- 3 . Such a big day for the entire team of @haminepal_ and the whole youths of Nepal.Being the first organization in Nepal to import Oxygen cylinders through chartered flight with the help of kind donors, it's really a proud moment for us all.Finally we managed to import 520 cylinders today from china and we distributed them the moment cylinders landed here in ktm considering the fact thay every minute is important and it could save lives.We were supposed to receive 540 cylinders but due to some technical issue we only received 520.

      "When we strive to become better than we are, everything around us becomes better too. Empathy is seeing through the eyes of another, listening with the ears of another, and feeling with the heart of another. We are not in it for income, we are in it for outcome. Today we succesfully gave away 1000 face mask, surgical gloves to the street vendors and the locals who weren't wearing it that time. We also pasted the notice and information of awareness and how you can manage your safety in this pandemic crisis at different places (Maru, Kasthamandap, Hanumandhoka, Makkhan, Indrachowk, Newroad, Basantapur). Well we really felt sorry for those who ignored to take the mask because they thought that it's fine to not wear a mask on public places. Please, if you are not going to wear a mask in public, then do not come outside. Think of your family, think of your relatives, think once of your neighborhood, because of your wrong decisions, because of you not wearing a mask in public, you'd be infected from the serious (covid-19) virus and through yours, your close one would be infected.",
