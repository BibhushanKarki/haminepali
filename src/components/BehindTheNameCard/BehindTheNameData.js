    desc: "On 25 April, 2015 an earthquake with a magnitude of 7.8 Richter scale struck Nepal along with continued aftershocks occurring throughout the nation at the intervals of 15–20 minutes. The earthquake affected a huge population of the nation with about 9,000 fatalities and nearly 22,000 injured people.All of the hospitals in Kathmandu were in chaos and unmanaged with injured people flowing in rapidly. The National Trauma Center, a government hospital, was no exception. After hearing the Information, several youths went to the trauma hospital and offered to volunteer in order to control the situation. Our organization founder, Mr. Sudan Gurung, was also one of them.The volunteering youths started calling themselves “I to We” at that time because of discrete reasons. However, the name was later changed into ‘HamiNepal’, which is roughly translated as ‘We for Nepal’. It is how people with helping intention came along and formed the HamiNepal Youth Organization.",
