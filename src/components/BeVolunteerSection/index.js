                To get register as a volunteer user needs to fill a form first
                which includes name, number, expertise in the field, and
                location. Once the form will be filled by the user for
                volunteer, their geo-location will be tracked so that
                notification will be sent to their specific mobile number in
                case if there is an emergency call out.
