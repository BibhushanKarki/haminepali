The research is conducted so that the Hami Nepal organisation could identify which hospital will make better use of the equipment without any profit-making.By doing this, we believe that most of the COVID-19 infected people can be treated in their home and severe people will easily find beds in hospitals. Also, hospitals will not need to worry about lack of oxygen for patients.",
