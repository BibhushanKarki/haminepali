          "Our team has already finalised to import an oxygen plant and we are conducting thorough research on which hospital will be hugely benefited with the provided oxygen plant. The research is conducted so that the Hami Nepal organisation could identify which hospital will make better use of the equipment without any profit-making.By doing this, we believe that most of the COVID-19 infected people can be treated in their home and severe people will easily find beds in hospitals. Also, hospitals will not need to worry about lack of oxygen for patients.",

          "Government provides support but that isnâ€™t enough. They need more care and a guide who can hold their hand and show them the right path. hIn this world, there are three most important things which society needs to make the world a better place. First is food, which is important to stay alive. Second is education which would uplift the minds of each individual and thus the world as whole. Third and last would be health. Each person needs proper health and medical assistance from time to time. We are seriously excited about our organization involved in the society. Helping orphans selflessly and seeing that our organization can be value to someone is truly satisfying. The thing which our organization is seeking is the happiness, the sparkle of achievement in the eyes of those children when they would gain knowlwdge and would be able to make their life worthwhile. This task is selflessly choosen and our organization never expected anything in return other than peace which we would get through it. Helping orphans is all it takes to be at peace and to develop the feeling of pride. Thinking about volunteering and helping the needy people is one thing and helping in reality is a different world altogether.",
