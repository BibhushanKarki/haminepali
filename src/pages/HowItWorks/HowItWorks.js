Hami Nepal directly connects donors and recipients to maintain transparency. The organisation doesnâ€™t spend any of the received donations on administration cost as we believe that 100% of the donation should reach the recipient in order to establish effective helping. All of our volunteers, mobilised for the authentication of the problem, logistics and delivery, cover their own expenses in order to save the administrative expense. We are implementing skill-based volunteering to facilitate healthcare services and mitigate the risk of this devastating COVID-19 cases surge, at the time being.</p>
